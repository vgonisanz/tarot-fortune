## Development

To start developing this project, clone this repo and do:

```bash
make env-create
```

This will create a virtual environment with all the needed dependencies
(using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
You can activate this environment with:

```bash
source ./.tox/tarot_fortune/bin/activate
```

Then, you can run `make help`.
Learn more about the different tasks
you can perform on this project using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

### Utils

- card-term-viewer: It is a helper to render in terminal images.
  That could help in development.
- tarot_csv_to_json: This is a CSV to JSON converter to ease data exchange.

### Upgrade dependencies

From scratch, use the following command to generate `requirements{-dev}.txt` files:

```bash
make env-compile
```
