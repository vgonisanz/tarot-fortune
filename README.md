- If you think this is all claptrap,
  you may or may not be right.
  But as a programming practice it is interesting.
  Don't you think?
  Surely you are a [skeptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism).
  Congratulations.
- If not, you are probably right and want to pay for my children's college.
  You can send me money and I'll schedule some more moves for you.

## Usage

TBD

## Development

To start developing this project, clone this repo and do:

```bash
make env-create
```

This will create a virtual environment with all the needed dependencies
(using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).
You can activate this environment with:

```bash
source ./.tox/tarot_fortune/bin/activate
```

Then, you can run `make help`.
Learn more about the different tasks
you can perform on this project using [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

### Extra Utils

These files are not included in the distributable.
You can use to do additional development tasks:

- card-term-viewer: It is a helper to render in terminal images.
  That could help in development.
- tarot_csv_to_json: This is a CSV to JSON converter to ease data exchange.

### Upgrade dependencies

From scratch, use the following command to generate `requirements{-dev}.txt` files:

```bash
make env-compile
```

## Dependencies

- [Term image](https://github.com/AnonymouX47/term-image): Still in development,
  It is a good dependency to render in terminal.
  Maybe in the future will add more interesting features (like flip or rotate)
- Other alternatives like [imgrender](https://github.com/djentleman/imgrender)
  can be used to this purpose.
- Pydantic, typer, rich and structlog are classics.
